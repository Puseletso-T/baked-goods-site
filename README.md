Description

Yum Baked Goods is a simple e-commerce style product display page for a bakery. The homepage shows a grid of baked-goods products (e.g. truffles, macaroons, cupcakes, cakes) with images, titles, prices, and a “Buy” button on each card. At the bottom there is a footer containing a contact form (Name and Email fields) and the company logo.

Features

Responsive Layout: Uses Bootstrap’s grid system to display products in a responsive, three-column layout.

Product Cards: Each product card shows an image of the item, the product name (title), price, and a “Buy” button.

Image Hover Effect: When you hover over a product image, it slightly zooms in (handled by a CSS transform) to enhance interactivity.

Contact Form: A simple footer form lets users enter their name and email to contact the business.

Company Logo: The footer also displays the company logo image (Logo.png).
